# Problem Statements for Exercises

## Exercise 0: Simple Menu
Implement a simple menu program that displays the following options to the user:
1. Show "Hello World" message.
2. Roll three dice and count the number of winning rolls.
3. Display Fibonacci sequence.
4. Exit the program.

The program should repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.

## Exercise 1: Operations on Two Numbers
Create a menu program that allows the user to perform operations on two positive integers. The menu should include the following options:
1. Calculate and display the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers.
2. Calculate and display the maximum of the two numbers.
3. Change the numbers to new values.
4. Exit the program.

The program should validate user input and ensure that the numbers are positive.

## Exercise 2: Date Management
Develop a program that manages a date represented by three variables: day, month, and year. The program should include the following functionalities:
1. Change the current date.
2. Add a specified number of days to the current date.
3. Display the current date.
4. Exit the program.

The program should validate the date input and consider leap years during validation.

## Exercise 3: Circle from Three Points
Construct a program that reads the coordinates of three non-collinear points in a 2D space and calculates the center and radius of the circle that passes through these points. The program should:
1. Read the coordinates of the three points.
2. Calculate the center (xc, yc) and radius (r) of the circle using the provided formulas.
3. Display the center and radius.
4. Handle cases where the points are collinear by notifying the user.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that all user inputs are validated.
- Provide clear instructions and error messages to guide the user through the programs.
- Include comments in the code to explain the logic and flow of the programs.
