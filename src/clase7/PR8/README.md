# PR8 Project

## Overview
The PR8 project consists of several C programs that demonstrate the use of data structures, specifically multidimensional arrays, and operations on matrices. The project includes exercises that involve counting colored points in a matrix, performing operations on rectangular matrices, and analyzing pollution data from satellite images.

## Directory Structure

```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Use the provided Makefile to compile the source files:
   ```
   make
   ```
4. The compiled binaries will be placed in the `bin` directory.

## Usage
- Each program can be executed from the `bin` directory after compilation.
- Refer to the `docs/PR8.md` file for detailed instructions on each exercise and how to run the programs.
